# GitHub Actions (Node.js) require built artifacts to be committed.
# Runners do not run `npm install` for actions; `runs.main`/`runs.post` must point to files in `dist/`.
# We generally ignore all dist directories, but allow the action’s dist so the action can execute.
# We need this specifically to engage post run hook for the e2e_release_mrt_target action to release the MRT target back to the pool.
